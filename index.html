  <h2>Biography</h2>
  <p>
      Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace, was an English mathematician
      and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage’s early
      mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine.
      <br><br>
      Ada Lovelace is widely regarded as the <strong>world’s first computer
      programmer</strong> because she published the first algorithm intended
      to be processed by a machine. Her visionary notes described how machines
      could go beyond calculation and create music, art, and text.
      <br><br>
      Her ideas laid the foundation for modern computing more than a century
      before computers were actually built.
